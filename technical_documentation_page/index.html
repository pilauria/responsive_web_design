          With our component plan worked out, it's now time to start updating
          our app from a completely static UI to one that actually allows us to
          interact and change things. In this article we'll do this, digging
          into events and state along the way, and ending up with an app in
          which we can successfully add and delete tasks, and toggle tasks as
          completed.

          If you've only written vanilla JavaScript before now, you might be
          used to having a separate JavaScript file, where you query for some
          DOM nodes and attach listeners to them. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
    <code
      >const btn = document.querySelector('button');<br /><br />
      btn.addEventListener('click', () => { <br />alert("hi!");<br />
      });</code
    >
  </pre>
        <p>
          In React, we write event handlers directly on the elements in our JSX,
          like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>    &lt;button
    type="button"
    onClick={() => alert("hi!")}
    &gt;
      Say hi!
    &lt;/button&gt;
  </code></pre>
        <p>
          In the above example, we're adding an <code>onClick</code> attribute
          to the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element. The value of that
          attribute is a function that triggers a simple alert. The
          <code>onClick</code> attribute has special meaning here: it tells
          React to run a given function when the user clicks on the button.
          There are a couple of other things to note:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The camel-cased nature of <code>onClick</code> is important — JSX
            will not recognize <code>onClick</code> (again, it is already used
            in JavaScript for a specific purpose, which is related but different
            — standard onclick handler properties).
          </li>
          <li>
            All browser events follow this format in JSX – on, followed by the
            name of the event.
          </li>
        </ul>
        The
        <p>
          camel-cased nature of <code>onClick</code> is important — JSX will not
          recognize <code>onClick</code> (again, it is already used in
          JavaScript for a specific purpose, which is related but different —
          standard onclick handler properties). All browser events follow this
          format in JSX – on, followed by the name of the event. Let's apply
          this to our app, starting in the <code>Form.js</code> component.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Handling_form_submission">
        <header class="header">Handling form submission</header>
        <p>
          At the top of the Form() component function, create a function named
          handleSubmit(). This function should prevent the default behavior of
          the submit event. After that, it should trigger an alert(), which can
          say whatever you’d like. It should end up looking something like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>function handleSubmit(e) {
      e.preventDefault();
      alert('Hello, world!');
    }</code></pre>
        <p>
          To use this function, add an onSubmit attribute to the &lt;form&gt;
          element, and set its value to the <code>handleSubmit</code> function:
        </p>
        <pre><code>&lt;form& onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
          Now if you head back to your browser and click on the "Add" button,
          your browser will show you an alert dialog with the words "Hello,
          world!" — or whatever you chose to write there.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Callback_props">
        <header class="header">Callback props</header>
        <p>
          In React applications, interactivity is rarely confined to just one
          component: events that happen in one component will affect other parts
          of the app. When we start giving ourselves the power to make new
          tasks, things that happen in the <code>&lt;Form /&gt;</code> component
          will affect the list rendered in <code>&lt;App /&gt;</code>.We want
          our <code>handleSubmit()</code> function to ultimately help us create
          a new task, so we need a way to pass information from
          <code>&lt;Form /&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;App /&gt;</code>. We can't
          pass data from child to parent in the same way as we pass data from
          parent to child using standard props. Instead, we can write a function
          in <code>&lt;App /&gt;</code> that will expect some data from our form
          as an input, then pass that function to <code>&lt;Form /&gt;</code>as
          a prop. This function-as-a-prop is called a callback prop. Once we
          have our callback prop, we can call it inside
          <code>&lt;Form /&gt;</code> to send the right data to
          <code>&lt;App /&gt;</code>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="State_and_the_useState_hook">
        <header class="header">State and the useState hook</header>
        <p>
          So far, we've used props to pass data through our components and this
          has served us just fine. Now that we're dealing with user input and
          data updates, however, we need something more. For one thing, props
          come from the parent of a component. Our<code>&lt;Form /&gt;</code>
          will not be inheriting a new name for our task; our<code
            >&lt;input /&gt;</code
          >
          element lives directly inside of <code>&lt;Form /&gt;</code>, so
          <code>&lt;Form /&gt;</code> will be directly responsible for creating
          that new name. We can't ask <code>&lt;Form /&gt;</code> to
          spontaneously create its own props, but we can ask it to track some of
          its own data for us. Data such as this, which a component itself owns,
          is called state. State is another powerful tool for React because
          components not only own state, but can update it later. It's not
          possible to update the props a component receives; only to read them.
          React provides a variety of special functions that allow us to provide
          new capabilities to components, like state. These functions are called
          hooks, and the useState hook, as its name implies, is precisely the
          one we need in order to give our component some state. To use a React
          hook, we need to import it from the react module. In Form.js, change
          your very first line so that it reads like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>import React, { useState } from "react";</code></pre>
        <p>
          This allows us to import the useState() function by itself, and
          utilize it anywhere in this file. useState() creates a piece of state
          for a component, and its only parameter determines the initial value
          of that state. It returns two things: the state, and a function that
          can be used to update the state later. This is a lot to take in at
          once, so let's try it out. We're going to make ourselves a name state,
          and a function for updating the name state. Write the following above
          your handleSubmit() function, inside Form():
        </p>
        <pre><code>const [name, setName] = useState('Use hooks!');</code></pre>
        <p>What's going on in this line of code?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We are setting the initial name value as "Use hooks!".</li>
          <li>
            We are defining a function whose job is to modify name, called
            setName().
          </li>
          <li>
            useState() returns these two things, so we are using array
            destructuring to capture them both in separate variables.
          </li>
        </ul>
