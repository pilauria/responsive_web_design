        <h3 id="info">Here's a time line of Prof. Paul Erdős:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1913</strong> - Born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1930</strong> - Enter Péter Pázmány University in Budapest:
            in four years he completed his undergraduate work and earned a Ph.D.
            in mathematics
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1934</strong> - Left the country for a four-year
            postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Manchester in England
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1938</strong> - Emigrated to the United States, he accept a
            one-year appointment at the Institute for Advanced Study in
            Princeton, New Jersey, where he cofounded the field of probabilistic
            number theory.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1940</strong> - He began half a century of nomadic existence
            around the world that would make him a legend in the mathematics
            community: he wandered around the United States from one university
            to the next declining full-time job offers so that he would have the
            freedom to work with anyone at any time on any problem of his choice
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1959</strong> - Attended the first International Conference
            on Graph Theory, a field he helped found.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1984</strong> - Won the Wolf Prize, the most lucrative award
            in mathematics, and used all but $720 of the $50,000 prize money to
            establish a scholarship in his parents’ memory in Israel
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1996</strong> Dies in Warsaw, Poland at the age of 83.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h3 class="interesting-first">Interesting facts <sup>&sup1;</sup></h3>
      <h4 class="interesting">Simple life</h4>
      <p>
        Most of his belongings would fit in a suitcase, as dictated by his
        itinerant lifestyle. Awards and other earnings were generally donated to
        people in need and various worthy causes. He spent most of his life
        traveling between scientific conferences, universities and the homes of
        colleagues all over the world. He would typically show up at a
        colleague's doorstep and announce "my brain is open", staying long
        enough to collaborate on a few papers before moving on a few days later.
        In many cases, he would ask the current collaborator about whom to visit
        next.
      </p>
      <h4 class="interesting">Erdős number</h4>
      <p>
        Because of his prolific output, friends created the Erdős number as a
        tribute. An Erdős number describes a person's degree of separation from
        Erdős himself, based on their collaboration with him, or with another
        who has their own Erdős number. Erdős alone was assigned the Erdős
        number of 0 (for being himself), while his immediate collaborators could
        claim an Erdős number of 1, their collaborators have Erdős number at
        most 2, and so on. Approximately 200,000 mathematicians have an assigned
        Erdős number.
